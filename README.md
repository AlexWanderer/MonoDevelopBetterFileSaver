MonoDevelop Better File Saver Add-in
==========================

This MonoDevelop/Xamarin add-in adds Save and Save All commands to the File menu that remove trailing whitespace before saving. There is also a Remove Trailing Whitespace item added to the Edit menu that will update the text in the currently open file without saving it. The new menu items will show up in your normal key bindings so you can just change them to map to Command/Ctrl+S and Command/Ctrl+Shift+S to get auto whitespace removal every time you save.
