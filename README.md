MonoDevelop Better File Saver AddIn
==========================

MonoDevelop AddIn that provides Save and Save All commands to the File menu that remove trailing whitespace before saving. Unfortunately, the MonoDeveloper "Remove trailing whitespace" option availble in the settings does not work at all. MonoDevelop can be a real fiesty PITA when it comes to extra whitespace and it eventually drove me completely nuts so now 
the Better File Saver AddIn exists to keep me sane.
